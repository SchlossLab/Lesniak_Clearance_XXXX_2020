Clearance of *Clostridioides difficile* colonization is associated with antibiotic-specific bacterial changes
=======

## Abstract

The gut bacterial community prevents many pathogens from colonizing the intestine. Previous studies have associated specific bacteria with clearing *Clostridioides difficile* colonization across different community perturbations. However, those bacteria alone have been unable to clear *C. difficile* colonization. To elucidate the changes necessary to clear colonization, we compared differences in bacterial abundance between communities able and unable to clear *C. difficile* colonization. We treated mice with titrated doses of antibiotics prior to *C. difficile* challenge which resulted in no colonization, colonization and clearance, or persistent colonization. Previously, we observed that clindamycin-treated mice were susceptible to colonization but spontaneously cleared *C. difficile*. Therefore, we investigated whether other antibiotics would show the same result. We found reduced doses of cefoperazone and streptomycin permitted colonization and clearance of *C. difficile*. Mice that cleared colonization had antibiotic-specific community changes and predicted interactions with *C. difficile*. Clindamycin treatment led to a bloom in populations related to *Enterobacteriaceae*. Clearance of *C. difficile* was concurrent with the reduction of those blooming populations and the restoration of community members related to the *Porphyromonadaceae* and *Bacteroides*. Cefoperazone created a susceptible community characterized by a drastic reduction in the community diversity, interactions, and a sustained increase in abundance of many facultative anaerobes. Lastly, clearance in streptomycin-treated mice was associated with the recovery of multiple members of the *Porphyromonadaceae*, with little overlap in the specific *Porphyromonadaceae* observed in the clindamycin treatment. Further elucidation of how *C. difficile* colonization is cleared from different gut bacterial communities will improve *C. difficile* infection treatments.
